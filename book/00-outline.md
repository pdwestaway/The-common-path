 Justification manifesto, statistics, origin story.


Book II – The View (Wisdom Canon)
 Seven virtues (Values)
 Liberating insights (Philosophy):

 Each module ends with a “Practice bridge” paragraph that points to rituals in Book III.


Book III – The Practice (Rituals & Community)
 Daily, weekly, life‑stage rites, plus identity‑craft tools (virtue autobiography, shared symbols).


Book IV – The Guardrails (Pitfalls & Protections)
 Bullying, gossip, corruption, dogma‑creep—paired with procedural antidotes.


(If length is daunting, Books III & IV can share a single “Community Handbook.”)

Curating philosophical teachings: three filters
Universality. Does the insight crop up in multiple cultures or map to known psychological principles?


Coherence. Can it live alongside empirical science without forcing metaphysical allegiance?


Practical leverage. Does it reliably change behavior or reduce suffering when applied?


The Three Doors of Liberation pass all three: they reframe reality (coherence), appear across Mahāyāna lineages (universality), and cultivate equanimity (leverage).
