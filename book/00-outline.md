# Framework for Integrating Philosophical Teachings into The Common Path

## Where do “Philosophical Teachings” belong?

Philosophical teachings belong in the **View** layer of the framework. They shape how we interpret life *before* we act—complementing and deepening the virtues. This four-layer structure organizes the full philosophical and practical corpus of The Common Path:

| Layer                      | Purpose                          | Typical Content                                                                 |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Need**                  | Explain *why* the project exists | Meaning crisis, loneliness data, historical failures                            |
| **View**                  | Provide a *coherent way of seeing* | Seven shared virtues • Impermanence • Three Doors of Liberation • Stoic control dichotomy • Indigenous reciprocity • Cognitive reframing |
| **Practice**              | Translate view into *ritual & habit* | Tea ceremony, weekly virtue challenge, service sash                             |
| **Governance / Guardrails** | Keep the system *healthy*         | Code of Civic Kindness, transparency rules, term limits                         |

## Suggested Book Architecture

1. **Book I – The Need**  
   Justification manifesto, psychological/sociological data, origin story.

2. **Book II – The View (Wisdom Canon)**  
   - Seven Shared Virtues  
   - Foundational philosophical teachings ("liberating insights"):  
     - Impermanence & non-self  
     - The Three Doors of Liberation  
     - Stoic Amor Fati  
     - Indigenous Reciprocity  
     - Modern cognitive-behavioral re-framing  
   - Each section concludes with a **"Practice Bridge"**—a short paragraph connecting philosophy to ritual.

3. **Book III – The Practice (Rituals & Community)**  
   - Daily, weekly, seasonal, and life-stage rituals  
   - Identity-as-practice tools: virtue autobiography, symbolic objects, service sashes  
   - Community design: hosting circles, listening formats, rites of inclusion

4. **Book IV – The Guardrails (Pitfalls & Protections)**  
   - Common dysfunctions (gossip, corruption, dogma drift, exclusion)  
   - Institutional safeguards and cultural commitments  
   - Procedural norms (e.g. transparency, rotating roles, accountability loops)

*Books III & IV may be merged into a single "Community Handbook" if length or cohesion warrants.*

## Curating Philosophical Teachings: Three Filters

To decide what philosophical ideas belong in The Common Path “Wisdom Canon,” use these filters:

1. **Universality**  
   - Does the teaching appear across cultures, or mirror known psychological principles?

2. **Coherence**  
   - Can it coexist with science and reason without requiring metaphysical allegiance?

3. **Practical Leverage**  
   - Does the teaching lead to clear improvements in well-being or moral development?

Examples that pass all three:  
- The Three Doors of Liberation  
- Stoic dichotomy of control  
- Growth mindset  
- Interdependent origination  
- The “observer self” from modern psychology
