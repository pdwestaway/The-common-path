# Teaching Proposals & Review Queue

> **Purpose:** Maintain a single, public list of philosophical teachings under consideration for the *Common Path* Wisdom Canon.  
> - New proposals are added to **“Under Review”** with blank scores.  
> - After scoring, rows are moved to **“Scored Proposals”** and kept **sorted by Total (highest → lowest)**.  
> - Once a teaching reaches Core-Insight status (≥ 12 by default weights) *and* passes community pilot, open a PR to migrate it into `/data/teaching-scores/` and Book II.

### Contribution Workflow

1. **Propose** – Add a row in “Under Review” and link (or embed) a 150-word summary.  
2. **Score** – Once the desk review + expert panel assign U/C/P, move the row to “Scored Proposals.”  
3. **Pilot** – Run a study-circle or practice pilot; update *Status*.  
4. **Promote** – If Total ≥ 12 **and** pilot feedback is positive, open a pull request to:  
   - Move YAML/CSV file into `/data/teaching-scores/`  
   - Update Book II (The View) with a “Practice Bridge” paragraph.  
5. **Audit** – All entries re-evaluated at biennial Canon review.

\*GitHub doesn’t auto-sort tables; just reorder rows manually on each update.
